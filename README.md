# FifaTop100

Welcome to FifaTop100 CLI Gem! Here you will find information on the Fifa rated top 100 players of 2019.

We utilise the Nokogiri Gem to scrape the official website and provide the information all in one application.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'fifa_top_100'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install fifa_top_100

## Walkthrough

Type in './bin/fifa_top_100'

![Image1](fifa_top_100/images/image1.png)
Once the App has loaded, you can select from the 4 options on the menu. We will select option 1
display the top 10 players from the list.

![Image2](fifa_top_100/images/image2.png)
The top 10 are now displayed, and we can now use the index beside each player to choose which player
to learn more about. We will select Cristiano Ronaldo, who is option 1.

![Image3](fifa_top_100/images/image3.png)
Cristano Ronaldo's details are now shown, with the option to search again for another Player,
or to end the app.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
